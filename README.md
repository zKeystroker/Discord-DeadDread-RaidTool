## What is Discord DeadDread multitool?

Discord DeadDread is a compilation of useful tools to help you raid discord servers and get discord accounts.

What sets Discord DeadDread apart from other similar projects is its emphasis on social engineering — Discord DeadDread is the toolkit for anyone looking to convince servers to add bots.

Unlike other raiders, the bots of Discord DeadDread come with geniune, fully fleshed out features, such as channel locking, global user banlists, fully configurable NSFW commands, and more! All with slash command support as of v1.3.0!
